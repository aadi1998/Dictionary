# Dictionary
Dictionaries are widely used and we often take spellchecking for granted. You will be required to
create a dictionary that not only provides the ability to search a word, but also to add new words,
delete existing words, and edit the definition of a word in the dictionary. For this project you
must ensure that you meet all of the following criteria.
1. You must implement a dictionary that contains not only words but also their definition.
2. You will be provided with a list of six different Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files
containing words and their definitions, as well as for each a list of operations to perform.
3. Your solution must be able to read in the data provided and create the dictionary as well
as process the accompanying file with the list of operations to perform.
4. Your program should also have a CLI so that a user can perform each of the operations
from the terminal such as searching for a word to retrieve the definition.
